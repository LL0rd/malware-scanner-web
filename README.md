# malware-scanner-web

This web-based scanner uses [libyara-wasm](https://github.com/mattnotmitt/libyara-wasm) and is based on [Yobi](https://github.com/imp0rtp3/Yobi).

By default it uses the YARA rules of [Linux Malware Detect](https://www.rfxn.com/downloads/rfxn.yara).

Performance will vary depending on the specific hardware.

Scanning is done on the client-side, no files are uploaded (you can check this).

This project is useful for scanning a few files with a defined set of YARA rules. For scanning much more files it is recommended to use the native YARA binaries because this web-bsed version causes a OOM (out of memory) error after consuming 1 GB of RAM (due to how webassemly works) and automatically restarts the scanner.

If you need YARA rules to detect malware in your website, do not hesitate to contact me.

There are also plans to create similar lite versions of my own scripts for checking files and databases.
